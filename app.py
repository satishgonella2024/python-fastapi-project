# User - FastAPI Application
# Generated based on AI analysis: The request clearly states the creation of a new Python application using FastAPI, with specific features and technical requirements. The mention of a single application with a basic folder structure and a README.md suggests a monolithic architecture. The confidence level is high due to the detailed and specific requirements provided.
